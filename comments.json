    "Hi,\n\nI\u2019m a graduate student here. I\u2019ve been diagnosed with ADHD as well as generalized anxiety since age eight and have been taking medications for it since then. If you are taking meds, this may apply to you. Otherwise, just read the very last two sentences of this comment.\n\nI was told recently by my psychiatrist that when your brain stops developing (18-24 years), it\u2019s possible that certain prescribed SSRIs or other medications used for ADD/ADHD (e.g., Ritalin) may become less effective and that you may want to change your meds up to better fit your adult brain.\n\nFor me, it was a switch from Ritalin to Adderall and from Zoloft to Lexapro that seemed to do the trick. However, it took me YEARS of struggling and several hospital visits to figure this out. Don\u2019t wait for it to get as bad as I did. Go now and tell them that you aren\u2019t feeling right because they will put you on medication/change it for you if you talk to them and tell them exactly how you feel.",
    "There\u2019s an extra scholarship",
    "Is it significant? I feel like I could get more aid with a higher act score, I\u2019m just not sure about the admissions rate.",
    "My year it was $5k per year for students who applied early action and were accepted. Weirdly, I can't find any info about it on RPI websites, though. I would check with the Financial Aid office to see if they're offering it, since $20k over four years is not an insignificant sum.",
    "So my next question is could I get in with my current stats? I have an average gpa for the school, 29 ACT and good ECs. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a good idea to take the risk and apply when I could improve my act score a good bit for rd.",
    "I mean RPI has a very high acceptance rate, so it's not the biggest risk in the world. I don't think I'd be able to give advice on that though.",
    "Right, but the average act is much higher than mine. Thanks for letting me know about the ea scholarship!",
    "Early Action, a 29 is already a really good ACT score like 90th percentile. There is not a huge jump between EA and RD. But I don't think the delta increase in your changes from your (act scores) is going to be bigger than EA to regular decision. plus you get a bit more money for EA. Also there is an official way to send additional score results.",
    "Right but the reported averages are a decent bit higher for engineering at rpi. I just don\u2019t want to risk getting declined if the rd and ea acceptance rates are relatively the same.",
    "RPI has a reputation for rigor. Schools and employers tend to know this, especially if they're big enough to have dealt with our alumni in the past.",
    "Big enough to have dealt with alumni and have enough leeway in the hiring process",
    "RPI is hard and less forgiving than other universities. \n\nGrain of salt, but I read a post on here once about someone who got into grad school with a 3.0 from RPI and their friend at Georgia Tech with a 3.5 didn\u2019t get into the same program, so schools may be aware of our rigor and give us some slack for it.",
    "Part of the answer is that there are plenty of people with GPAs good enough for grad school. Maybe they swim in different social circles than you, or you just don't have a big enough sample size, but they're definitely out there. It is a fact though that RPI over the decades has had less grade inflation than most peer institutions.",

If you got into RPI you probably will do well on GREs or GMATs which are also used in many grad school admissions processes and will help substantiate that you\u2019re qualified.

I also did get my MS in it, so while I'm sure it's not quite the same there should be some general overlap. Happy to answer any specific questions if you have any, but will give some general tips:\n\nI recommend taking some Comp Sci classes or learning some on your own. Will be very helpful, especially later on in the program re: Machine Learning and Data Resource Management. From my understanding, you only really need Python and SQL.\n\nIf you struggle with math, I'd recommend brushing up on it as much as you can. Khan academy is a great resource, and MIT has a bunch of lectures on YouTube, but in general I didn't find most of the BSAN/non-theoretical math very difficult, but YMMV.",
    "Thank you! Planning to get most of the math out of the way at CC now but obviously still have some ahead of me so i\u2019ll be sure to check out those resources.",

You\u2019re right \u2014 RPI\u2019s tech-driven environment really shapes how we at Lally approach business education. The coursework is rigorous but gives you plenty of hands-on experience with analytics, data tools, and real-world problem-solving.\n\nHappy to answer any questions about the program or the transfer process. Feel free to DM me here or email me at [**holtl3@rpi.edu**]() if that\u2019s easier.",
    "I am currently bsan &amp; I definitely recommend brushing up on your coding skills because data structures and CS 1 is a requirement for the BSAN to graduate! Same with math, bc u have to take calc 1, 2 &amp; 3 if I were you I\u2019d definitely take data structures at CC if you can before you transfer or maybe take it in the summer because the grade average is below 50 for certain exams lol I can tell you more if you want about curriculum and etc!",

    "I have a friend on student government that's been part of a push to use preferred names wherever possible. They told me that the usage of legal names on the new SIS is an oversight and that the Registrar was made aware of the problem in the last few weeks and is working on fixing it. It's a new system and they just didn't do a good job in the transition. It's disappointing, but I assure you it's not malice, just a technical mishap that will hopefully be fixed very soon.",
    "Yeah, no idea who you are but you're right on it. I'm the chair of the Senate's Student Life Committee, and I brought this issue up to DotCIO several weeks back, and then it got kicked to the Registrar's office. I mentioned it to the Registrar on Thursday and they are working on it. We'll keep following up until it's fixed. Reach out to me (noblez@rpi.edu) or someone on the Senate if you have additional questions.",
    "They've been aware of it for much longer than that, I know because trans students have been trying to get it changed for much longer than that. This is 100x worse than that, though. Legal sex is harder to change than legal name. I'm from a state that bans it so I can't change my legal sex until I permanently move, period. Every state allows name changes. This completely outs you to professors, and to any students who see a roster (eg. in courses that take attendance). Being outed is dangerous, this is putting trans students at RPI in harm's way\n\nLast semester we were explicitly told that they \"were working on\" not printing deadnames on packages picked up from the mail center, and they still do that. How long do I need to wait before my privacy and safety stops being compromised? Maybe it will be done next semester, I just need to hope no one decides to harass me in the meantime? It was completely fine before. They broke it, apparently didn't test it or put any thought into it, and now we have to wait God only knows how long for them to fix it while it fucks up our lives in the meantime.",
    "I can talk about the packages as well, actually. I met with the director of the mail center and someone else in the auxiliary services division (forgot his title sorry) a few weeks ago. Banner, the school's database, holds fields for preferred and legal name. For most things, like rosters and hopefully SIS, the change is just pulling the preferred name instead of legal.\n\nThe mailroom is an exception to this because if we alter the data going into the software, it will make it impossible in some cases for them to determine the intended recipient of a package. Sometimes people address mail to someone's preferred name, sometimes legal, and there are a lot of people with very similar names. They showed me the system and the process for finding people, and it was clear they needed both.\n\nThe other option is to alter how the software prints labels once the recipient has been selected. This is possible in theory, but we license the software from an external company, so we're working with people outside the Institute. I've drafted an email to their support line, and I'm waiting for the GM to read it over before I send it. No idea what they'll say, so no promises on the mailroom, but we are trying.",
    "The mailroom thing isn't as important as this, but fixing this *can't* take as long as other stuff. Imagine if they added a feature that puts everyone's sexual orientation in front of their name, and then sorts the class rosters by orientation. It would be completely insane and there would be tons of pressure for them to change it because of how completely horrible it would be for gay students. What they did is just as bad as that for trans students. This needs to be fixed ASAP",
    "They\u2019re working on it",
    "Your concerns are completely valid, especially with the situation in the country the way it is. Over the summer, stugov complained about professor/RA attendance lists and the mail room to upper admin. Most of the things you're saying now were also said then, and I was told that admin had made several changes to correct these problems, and was working on doing more. This was before new SIS, which is just new-system jank in the worst possible place.\n\nIt's disappointing that they haven't gone anywhere since then on many of those issues, but if you reach out to student government members with details, they'll find the administrators who oversee those things and agitate until they get fixed. The trouble is that with the administration as big as it is, someone high-level can say \"this is very important, fix it\" and then nothing happens because the lower-level people never get the same message. It's unacceptable considering what's at stake, obviously, and you're completely right to be pissed with them being this sloppy with something so important.\n\n(I was going to write something here about packages but apparently someone answered it before I could)",
    "STAR (trans club on campus) is going to send a letter tomorrow, it's just upsetting and based on past experiences I have doubts they'll do anything in the appropriate timeframe.

    "I don't know if Banner, which powers SIS, is a discount software platform.

And, yes, I know this sounds like an excuse.  It's still true, though.",

    "Wow...I worked on implementing BANNER on a SUNY campus back in the early 90's.  Still running on VAX/VMS?  Lol!!  Some of this boils down to bad queries and sorting/printing the output, it really should be that hard to fix.",
    "Is it possible to change your pronouns or preferred title instead of just changing your gender?",
    "It is possible to change your pronoun and preferred first name (and gender).  For students, the preferred first name change request needs approval from the Registrars office.  That has been in place for a few years.  In addition, the ability to select your prefix (honorific) was enabled yesterday.\n\nA second issue is how and where Banner/SIS uses these fields.  There are folks working on this now - I am not up on the details as I work on the directory side of things.  At this point, the prefix (honorific) is not included in the online directory, but that may change eventually.",

I'm '06 and they haven't made a league semi-final (a stage, you'll note, that a full third of the league reaches every year) since I enrolled. They haven't scored a goal in the NCAA tournament since I was six months old. At a certain point it feels like an exercise in futility.\n\nI don't get it because I had season tickets my last three years at RPI, and I've traveled to see the team not only at Union, but also in Detroit (GLI) and at Minnesota, St. Cloud, UConn, Notre Dame, Miami (Ohio), Denver, Colorado College, Arizona State, and Fairbanks. And there's a lot of incredible memories there. Some of those revolve around wins, sure, but by no means all. \n\nSo you should go, yell about how much Clarkson sucks, and have a good time. If and when things improve, you can say you were there when things were crap.",
    "Was at the blackout game with a group of 12. Most of their first time. The team had little to no fight, hard to make fans when they go out and play 1/3 of a game. I had season tickets 3 years as a student but haven\u2019t been able to get out to many of the games this semester. Are we back?\n\nI love RPI hockey. It\u2019s embarrassing that we have such a good culture and history but the large majority of the student population does not care. Needs to be fixed, but how?",

It\u2019s a great sign if we can keep it up.\n\nMarty has made it a priority to turn things around, and we\u2019re planning on investing in major upgrades to the field house\u2026 but students can\u2019t be bothered to show up for our biggest rivalry? I dunno. It\u2019s not a good look. Making attendance free for students might be the way to go.\n\n(For anyone wanting to get into RPI hockey I recommend following \u201cThe Field House\u201d on substack, https://open.substack.com/pub/thefieldhouse)",

    "Keep winning at a consistent pace and they'll get the fans back",
    "I already feel bad when I go to an RPI Hockey game. Why should I feel bad for not going? \n\nAlso there are a multitude of other reasons why RPI's Hockey attendance is so low:\n\n1. Games are $6 for students. That's too high if you want students in there every weekend.\n2. RPI plays horribly. They have a record of 2-8 total, or 2-2 in the division. No one wants to spend time and money to watch a team that won't do anything worthwhile.\n3. The ECAC is sorely behind the times. Each barn in the division may be nostalgic, but compared to other D1 schools, RPI is lacking the facilities to draw students. \n4. RPI is always in crunch time with homework. Plus, it's midterm season for 8 weeks of the semester. Who has time to go to a game when students have to spend the whole weekend studying or working?\n5. Theres a lack of care put into jerseys or merchandise. I can barely get a jersey, and if i even got one, they dont really look that good. Bring back puckman on the jerseys. \n\nThere's more issues present, but those are the biggest ones I can name off the top of my head.",
    "Some very good points...\n\n1. Agreed, games should to be cheaper/free until demand is greater than supply.\n2. 2-2-0 is a decent conference record for this early in the season. Only one other team has played 4 conference games... Union. They are also 2-2-0. Believe it or not, we are currently in a 3-way tie for first place in the league with 6 points, along with Dartmouth and Union. Will that last? Almost certainly not. But this is actually an exciting time to show up to the field house, moreso than just about any time in the last 5 years.\n3. I don't know the exact details but upgrading the field house is explicitly listed as a priority in Marty's \"RPI Forward\" campaign.\n4. Clarkson presumably has similar academic demands as RPI. Not saying it's identical but they're not a party school. Their hockey culture is on another tier, but it's actually just the tier that RPI *used to be at*.\n5. Hard agree on this one. I'd love to buy on-ice jerseys rather than the cheap pajama version that they sell for fans. I'd pay top dollar, especially if they bring back puckman.",
    "Glad we're on the same page. Personally I'd love to be at every game, but money/homework really gets in the way. Especially as an Archi",
    "For some reason, I feel like more students would go if you could drink a beer in the stands. Yknow, like other venues",
    "That would help, but drinking amongst Gen Z is the lowest of any generation. You'd only be able to bring in on average about 40% of people over 21 with that. So, like, maybe 500 people? And how many of those people would even be interested in a drunken hockey game when the pressure to perform academically in a slumping economy is at an all-time high?",
    "I didn't even know that the RPI hockey team was even playing. Also most of the people who get into RPI are not super into sports and there are a lot of introverts so we do not have much a a sports culture like a lot of other colleges.",
    "RPI had the best college hockey pep band/student section in the 90\u2019s/00\u2019s. \n\nPut the band back behind the goal!!",

    "I graduated 20 years ago and recently was sent pictures from the Alumni Weekend' game. It was horrifying how empty the field house was.",
    "nobody wants to go, i barely hear anybody talk about going to games and when you do go it\u2019s empty. The freakout game was fun bc every seat was full but in the 80s there was nothing to do except go to the games, unfortunately now the type of kids this school attracts would rather play Valorant or whatever in their rooms on fridays and saturdays. I would go to almost every game if my friends cared but they almost never want to go unless the tickets are free and even then they don\u2019t care about hockey. From what i\u2019ve heard from alumni it used to be awesome but i really don\u2019t see any way this student base would ever care about sports like we used to unless they are a national title contender, maybe. Sucks but what can you do",
    "Yeah, cause everyone studies too much.",
    "I\u2019d have been there if I could have",
    "Considering our home record the last two seasons, I have to give most RPI fans a pass about missing the game...  I dug into our records post-COVID, and here is the data:\n\n&gt; 24-25:  3 wins, 16 home games\n\n&gt; 23-24:  3 wins, 15 home games\n\n&gt; 22-23:  12 wins, 19 home games\n\n&gt; 21-22:  9 wins, 20 home games\n\nSimply put, the team was not doing their part at home the last two years, and it eroded fan support.  Why should folks come out, spend their time and money on an event to only have their spirits crushed repeatedly.\n\nTo be clear, I say this as a season ticket holder since like 2012...  I'm ride or die.  But the vast majority of people aren't, and until the team puts a good product on the ice, I won't give them grief for missing the games.\n\nThat said, I'm cautiously optimistic the last few weeks, seeing us take out Union then Clarkson.  Play has been steadily improving, both in goal, on offense, and on defense too.  Plenty of issues left to address, but we are moving in the right direction.",
    "I would put a year's worth of non-aid tuition that if tickets were free for and they sold and advertised $1 beers, greek life would fill a quarter of the stands alone. Then they invite their non-greek friends because it's a good time and they invite their friends and so on.\n\nAnother solution I thought of is making a big deal out of the opening game of the season, particularly for freshmen, and making that game free. If your first weekend of college you go to an RPI hockey game and have a fun time with friends, you're likely to want to keep going throughout the season.

    "&gt; Engineers score three shorthanded goals to give Eric Lang first win as RPI coach...\n\n&gt; SCHENECTADY - Eric Lang earned his first victory as RPI men's hockey coach in memorable fashion on Friday night.\n\n&gt; Freshman goalie Nate Krawchuk made 45 saves and the Engineers scored three shorthanded goals in a 5-2 victory over Route 7 rival Union in the ECAC Hockey opener for both teams in front of 2,034 fans at M&amp;T Bank Center.\n\n&gt; The Engineers, who had lost their first six games against a grueling nonconference schedule, improved to 1-6 overall, 1-0 in league play.\n\n&gt; \"Yeah, I've got some pretty neat pucks in the collection, whatever it might look like, but tonight's puck will be pretty special for me,\" Lang said \"It's really good against our crosstown rival. The room was a little emotional.\"\n\n&gt; Lang previously spent nine seasons at American International College, where he won 155 games.\n\n&gt; Union (4-1-1, 0-1) suffered its first loss in a performance that disappointed coach Josh Hauge.\n\n&gt; \"You know you're going to get a great effort from (RPI),\" Hauge said. \"It's ECAC play, and the level definitely steps up. I thought that we did some things tonight where you can't win hockey games if you're going to mismanage the puck and they took advantage.\"\n\n&gt; The game turned in the second period while Union was on a five-minute power play. RPI graduate winger Luciano Wilson received a game misconduct with 6:33 left for using his stick to apparently hit Garnet Chargers defenseman DJ Hart between the legs.\n\n&gt; Union tied the game at 2-2 a minute later on Etienne Lessard's power-play goal, and appeared poised for more with four minutes left on the major.\n\n&gt; But RPI junior winger Ethan Bono responded with a shorthanded goal after Union defenseman Tyler Dunbar lost control of the puck in his own end to give the Engineers the lead for good at 3-2 with 2:13 left in the period.\n\n&gt; \"Obviously, it's not ideal going down for five minutes, but I thought we responded well,\" Bono said. \"The kill was good all night and after they scored that tying goal, we kind of just said we have to lock in here. I thought our kill was great after that, and obviously, that goal felt pretty good. Going ahead on the kill going into the third period is something that we want.\"\n\n&gt; The lead was safe with Krawchuk, a native of Thunder Bay, Ont., who earned his first college victory in an outstanding performance.\n\n&gt; Still protecting a 3-2 lead, Krawchuk and his teammates kept their cool even after Union pulled goalie Cameron Korpi (26 saves) for an extra skater with 2:13 left in regulation. Then RPI's Trevor Russell was whistled for tripping with 1:15 left, putting the Engineers at a 6-on-4 disadvantage.\n\n&gt; \"Obviously, things got a little chaotic, but that's how things happen on the kill, especially 6-on-4 in the last couple of minutes,\" Krawchuk said. \"But you just breathe, take it shot-by-shot, minute-by-minute and don't think about it. Just go out there and play.\"\n\n&gt; RPI sealed the victory with two shorthanded empty-net goals in the final 38.2 seconds, the first by Tyler Wallace and the second from Cole Gordon.\n\n&gt; \"I mean, it sucks,\" Union sophomore winger Connor Smith said. \"They played well, we weren't ready to go. I don't think they're a better team than us.\"\n\n&gt; RPI and Union will meet again Saturday at Houston Field House in Troy.\n\n&gt; \"We're going to be a lot more ready tomorrow,\" Smith said.",

    "Thanks for sharing this.  I checked out the plan because I was curious to see what the project looked like.  It was a bit tough to visualize, but my initial reaction is that it seems like the plan has some good mixed with some not so great scope creep.  \n\nThe idea of creating a better way to enter/exit the Congress St bridge is not a bad one.  I don't know if this plan accomplishes that goal, but it's probably better than the existing traffic pattern.  The Ferry St tunnel has needed repair for a long time so that seems fine.  The ADA and accessibility crossing changes also seem like good improvements to the city.\n\nThe scope creep seems to come from removing a lot of parking and adding what looks like a poorly thought out bike lane.  I'm not a fan of reducing the travel lanes for bike lanes, but I understand that others feel differently.  Regardless, as designed, the bike lane proposed seems like it will increase the number of interactions between bikes and motorists with people getting super frustrated about the worse parking situation, heavier traffic and slower travel times.  I think this will increase friction in the community.\n\nAdditionally, the tree removal seems excessive.\n\nFinally, the idea of people walking/biking in the Ferry St tunnel seems super unsafe.  That spot is going to be prime real estate for panhandlers and opportunistic crime.  Besides, it gives me 'Stephen King in The Stand walking through the Holland Tunnel' vibes.",
    "with you on the tree removal and ADA compliance. I think the bike lane should be kept, having dedicated bike lanes like these aren't seen too often in the region, but have been shown to work really well in other cities.",
    "I get your take.  I guess I should clarify that my issue is more with the design proposed for this bike lane that looks like it will lead to more bicycle-to-motorist interactions, which are super dangerous for cyclists.  Also, the removal of a lot of parking is a problem.  Troy already struggles with parking and this will make popular events tougher for people to come to Troy.",

My take is that which side you fall on depends primarily on one thing: how good are you at learning?\n\nIf you are the kind of person who understands material after getting it explained once, or can complete examples alongside the professor's lecture, you will enjoy Lvov's style, which is basically explain once and do a couple examples, with random anecdotes and other antics interspersed to break things up.

    "To answer your questions imo:\n\n1. CANOS is harder than CoCo but both classes are not bad and are solid\n\n2. Algo is prob harder than DS/FOCs nowadays. DS back then was harder than both FOCs/Algo then but that\u2019s just me\n\n3. Circuits is definitely harder than Embedded and uses a lot more math and theory than embedded does. Embedded is just a microcontroller programming course\n\nOverall: it seems like a bad idea to take em all in the same one but if you believe in yourself go for it",
    "Circuits it absolutely your most important class out of these, but also the hardest and most time-consuming. I would not do Algo and Circuits at the same time. CANOS + Circuits should be fine though.\n\n\n...\n\nGod I miss Hameed  \ud83d\ude22",

    "No :(",
    "Well I guess it's good they made the class a bit easier then.\n\nCircuits combines time management with somewhat complex math and problem solving. I found the content to be pretty fun. It's basically Intro to ECSE, but with differential equations! Lets you solve much bigger and more complicated circuits.\n\nWhen I took the class with Sawyer, she was doing an experimental flipped style where we were mostly doing exercises with some lecture scattered in, rather than the other way around. That isn't the norm though, and I can't speak for any other professor.",

    "IED will be more of a semester long group project, with a larger group, whereas Inventor Studio is split into two projects, one with a small group and one that is done individually (or by pairs). Inventor Studio focuses more on identifying problems and innovating solution ideas for them while IED is focused more on a single engineering design. In IED, you can lean on your teammates more to fill tasks you are not as good at, but at the same time your project's success and grade is more influenced by the team than your individual capabilities. Both will take up a lot of time.\n\nWithout knowing your goals and interests, I cannot recommend one over the other, but hopefully these distinctions will help you make the decision.",

    "I'm an undergrad so I can't necessarily comment on what the grad experience will be like, but as a school overall RPI is pretty good. The professors are all very clearly knowledgeable of the content they're teaching and a lot of the time have applicable industry experience to give you a sense of how you can apply the things you're learning, and are very willing to help their students succeed. The administration has been doing a fairly good job at communicating with the students their plans and intentions for the campus and community, a stark contrast to what I've heard it was like 10 years ago. At least as an undergrad there are tons of events and clubs to join to socialize, and I see advertisements for graduate student activities quite frequently if you're looking to get involved with the community, but I don't know any specifics about them.\u00a0\n\n\nTroy definitely isn't the worst city but it could be better. I've never felt unsafe walking downtown or around the outskirts of the RPI campus, but the campus security does send out occasional emails about thefts and car break-ins around the area. Last month there were a few shots fired in the middle of the night but it didn't seem like anything violent, just someone keeping the property value down. If you lived very close to campus you'd probably never really notice anything.\u00a0\n\n\nIn terms of just living here there's all kinds of stores about a 10ish minute drive from the campus so you'll never have to travel far for most household items and groceries. If you're looking for places to live there's tons of apartments, rental companies and landlords with properties both right next to campus and in the Troy area in general, with rent ranging typically anywhere between 400-900/month. There are CDTA buses that are free with RPI ID and stop right next to campus that can take you around Troy or into some neighboring cities like Albany, Saratoga or Schenectady, albeit not very quickly.\u00a0\n\n\nI hope this was helpful :)\u00a0",

You will probably be able to find other students with similar interests as you social/academic. \n\nIf you are looking for a big party life you won\u2019t find it here, it is easier to focus on academics and grow your career.

You'd think that surely that would count. If NSF isn't doing those programs anymore, surely other programs exist. It was full-time 40-hour weeks of research for 7 weeks at another institution where I lived in their dorms (for free). Very formative and important for my varying decisions around grad school. Did this and a SURP.\n\nI'm now a PhD student at a highly ranked program for my field after working for a few years and getting a master's at *the* top program in a related field.

When I was at RPI (graduated 2014), there was a subset of students who wouldn't work part-time unrelated jobs, either, in addition to not finding meaningful summer internships and the like. At interviews during various stages of my career, I've given examples from my part-time semester jobs. I've always understood the need to encourage students to seek out something besides just coursework, but this can be gathered through a part-time job putting food on the table and paid summer research like I did.

Was that done largely through alumni donations after Shirley left? Has the Arch program been as successful as anticipated? How many students sought and were granted exemptions? Were prospective students not coming to RPI because of Arch? There must be a bottom line of an Institute finance document supporting this change, but how is the equation changing? Looking forward to hearing more about this.",
    "A lot of it seemed to just be student input! Nobody really liked being 'forced' to do the Arch Summer semester. They mentioned that students essentially had to lie and say they intended on staying for the summer (when in reality, they were searching for internships and planned to get an exemption.) This meant that numbers were not forecasted well\u2013 and made budgeting for Arch harder. (As such, the quality of the program decreases, too.)\n\nThey do want to keep the summer semester an option, and there's a big emphasis on having students play a key role on reshaping these new programs to ensure that there's still a reason to stay over the summer. (Fun events, unique opportunities, etc)",
    "sooo does that mean that there is going to be even less class options over the summer...",
    "I always heard Arch was kept a bit after Shirley left because of how big the class of 26 and 27 are: now that those classes are both upperclassmen now the overcrowding issue is gone",
    "That was one of the original justifications for the program - that with Arch they could admit more students since some of the students would be gone the one semester. I remember arguing to the administration that they needed metrics to define what success and failure is, and they said they would put those in place, but I never saw anything.",

    "talk with your advisor if possible, the chart they made does account for LoAs, and I do assume that would be adjusted for w/ regards to summer semesters\n\n  \nmore importantly, arch exemptions have been incredibly lenient in the past few years, and (from my personal understanding) this is just a more official way of going about that entire exemption process.\n\n  \nLater in the week I'll clarify with the CCPD how the summer requirement will work for those who took a LoA and report back",
    "Just got word back\u2013 \"No summer term is mandatory anymore so they just need to take the ILEA 4400 and ADMN 1030 at some point before they graduate.\"\n\n  \nAs long as you complete those two requirements, you should be all set!",
    "ADMN-1030 is a 0 credit prep class for your Arch Experience. Basically throughout the semester you'll be polishing up your resume, researching companies and applying to internships. The course should be taken the Spring of your sophomore year, unless you do an early Arch, so i wouldn't move that around.\u00a0\n\n\nI would recommend taking a HASS course next semester if you want to reduce your credit load in third year. Most HASS courses are pretty easy and low time commitment, and still count towards your graduation requirements (your Pathway or general HASS credit count). If you'd rather something more related to your degree and already have the prerequisites, Physics II or Multivariable Calculus are medium difficulty courses that are moderately time consuming but not *too* bad, and the quicker you complete them the sooner you can have more options relevant to your major.\u00a0",
    "I just realized I misunderstood your situation, ignore the part about physics and multi just do a HASS course",
    "ECSE 2900 is a seminar class. It\u2019s a required class where you literally have a single group presentation to present throughout the semester and that\u2019s it. Your presentation date is randomly assigned and so is your topic. You\u2019ll be notified in 2 weeks about your project and it\u2019s a pretty easy class as long as you don\u2019t abysmally mess up your presentation. Free A basically.",
    "I\u2019d recommend moving up a hass if you\u2019re stuck in pre requirements with only 13\n\nECSE 2900 is a seminar where you get lectures from a bunch of different people in their respective fields and then it\u2019s just a crap ton of group presentations. Fairly easy and simple class. \n\nYou should talk to your advisor though.",
    "Left on read",
    "Find when their office hours are and just show up. Sometimes its the only way to talk to some people, and gets you immediate answers\u00a0",
